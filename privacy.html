      <p>
        This Privacy Policy explains how <strong>Neo Runner Arcade</strong> (“we”, “us”, “our”, or “the site”)
        collects, uses, and shares information when you visit or use our Mini Game Hub and the games available on it.
      </p>
      <p>
        By using this website, you agree to the practices described in this Privacy Policy. If you do not agree,
        please discontinue use of the site and its games.
      </p>

      <h2>1. Information We Collect</h2>

      <h3>1.1 Information you provide directly</h3>
      <p>
        Our games are designed for quick play in the browser and typically do not require account creation.
        In most cases, you will not be asked to provide personal data such as your name or email.
      </p>
      <p>
        If we later add contact forms, feedback forms, or newsletter sign-ups, we may collect the information you provide
        (for example, email address or feedback message) and use it only for the purposes explained at the time of collection.
      </p>

      <h3>1.2 Automatically collected information (log & usage data)</h3>
      <p>
        When you access the site, certain information may be collected automatically by our hosting provider
        and analytics tools (if enabled), such as:
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li>IP address and approximate location (country/region);</li>
        <li>Browser type and version, operating system, device type;</li>
        <li>Referring/exit pages and URLs;</li>
        <li>Date/time of visits and pages or games viewed;</li>
        <li>Crash reports or basic performance data.</li>
      </ul>
      <p>
        This data is generally used in aggregated form to understand how players use the site and to maintain security.
      </p>

      <h3>1.3 Cookies and similar technologies</h3>
      <p>
        We use cookies and similar technologies to:
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li>Remember basic preferences (for example, which games you play most, if stored locally);</li>
        <li>Measure traffic and usage statistics (analytics cookies, if enabled);</li>
        <li>Show ads through partners such as Google AdSense (advertising cookies, if enabled).</li>
      </ul>
      <p>
        Many of these cookies are set by third-party providers (for example, Google) and are subject to their own policies.
      </p>

      <h2>2. Advertising (Google AdSense)</h2>
      <p>
        We may display ads on this site using <strong>Google AdSense</strong> and other advertising partners.
        These providers may use cookies, web beacons, and similar technologies to:
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li>Serve and personalize ads based on your visits to this and other websites;</li>
        <li>Measure the effectiveness of ad campaigns;</li>
        <li>Prevent fraud and abuse.</li>
      </ul>
      <p>
        Google’s use of advertising cookies enables it and its partners to serve ads to you based on your visit to this site
        and/or other sites on the Internet.
      </p>
      <p>
        You can learn more about how Google uses data and how to manage your preferences in Google’s policies:

      </p>

      <h2>3. Legal Basis for Processing (EEA / UK Users)</h2>
      <p>
        If you are in the European Economic Area (EEA), the UK, or a region with similar laws, we rely on
        the following legal bases to process your personal data:
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li><strong>Consent</strong> – for non-essential cookies (analytics / advertising) and personalized ads;</li>
        <li><strong>Legitimate interests</strong> – for essential site operation, security, and basic, non-personalized statistics;</li>
        <li><strong>Legal obligations</strong> – where we must retain or disclose data to comply with applicable laws.</li>
      </ul>

      <h2>4. Your Privacy Choices & Rights</h2>

      <h3>4.1 Cookie consent & preferences</h3>
      <p>
        When you first visit the site, you are presented with a cookie banner that lets you accept or reject
        non-essential cookies (such as analytics and advertising cookies). You can also reopen your choices at any time
        using the <strong>“Privacy &amp; Cookies”</strong> settings button shown on the site.
      </p>
      <p>
        If you reject non-essential cookies, we will still use essential cookies that are necessary for the basic
        functioning and security of the site.
      </p>

      <h3>4.2 Rights for EEA / UK users (GDPR)</h3>
      <p>If you are in the EEA or UK, you may have the following rights under GDPR and similar laws:</p>
      <ul>
        <li>Right of access – to request a copy of personal data we hold about you;</li>
        <li>Right to rectification – to request correction of inaccurate or incomplete data;</li>
        <li>Right to erasure – to request deletion of personal data, subject to legal obligations;</li>
        <li>Right to restriction of processing – in certain circumstances;</li>
        <li>Right to data portability – to receive personal data in a structured, commonly used format;</li>
        <li>Right to object – to certain types of processing (such as direct marketing);</li>
        <li>
          Right to withdraw consent – where processing is based on your consent (for example, for advertising cookies),
          you may withdraw at any time.
        </li>
      </ul>

      <h3>4.3 Rights for California and similar jurisdictions (CCPA/CPRA)</h3>
      <p>
        If you are a resident of California (or a region with similar laws such as the CPRA), you may have rights including:
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li>The right to know what categories of personal information are collected and how they are used;</li>
        <li>The right to request access to the personal information we hold about you;</li>
        <li>The right to request deletion of your personal information, subject to certain exceptions;</li>
        <li>
          The right to opt out of the “sale” or “sharing” of personal information
          (for example, for cross-context behavioral advertising).
        </li>
      </ul>
      <p>
        On this site, your choice to <strong>Reject non-essential cookies</strong> is treated as an opt-out of
        cookies used for targeted advertising or “sale/sharing” of personal data as defined by applicable law.
      </p>

      <h2>5. Data Retention</h2>
      <p>
        We retain log data, analytics data, and other information for as long as necessary to fulfill the purposes
        described in this policy, unless a longer retention period is required or permitted by law.
      </p>
      <p>
        Local data stored in your browser (for example, game scores or “most played” info) is generally stored
        on your device only and can be cleared via your browser settings.
      </p>

      <h2>6. Children’s Privacy</h2>
      <p>
        This site and its games are intended for a general audience and are not specifically directed to children
        under the age where parental consent is required by law (for example, under 13 or under 16 depending on jurisdiction).
      </p>
      <p>
        We do not knowingly collect personal information from children without appropriate consent.
        If you believe that a child has provided us with personal information, please contact us and we will
        take steps to delete such information where required.
      </p>

      <h2>7. Sharing of Information</h2>
      <p>
        We do not sell personal information in the traditional sense. We may share information with:
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li>
          <strong>Service providers</strong> – such as hosting providers, analytics providers, and ad networks
          (for example, Google AdSense), who process data on our behalf;
        </li>
        <li>
          <strong>Authorities or third parties</strong> – if required by law, court order, or to protect our rights,
          security, or property;
        </li>
        <li>
          <strong>Business transfers</strong> – if we are involved in a merger, acquisition, or other transfer of assets.
        </li>
      </ul>

      <h2>8. International Transfers</h2>
      <p>
        Our service providers (for example, Google) may process data in multiple countries.
        Where required by law, appropriate safeguards (such as Standard Contractual Clauses) are used to protect
        personal data transferred outside your region.
      </p>

      <h2>9. Security</h2>
      <p>
        We take reasonable technical and organizational measures to protect your data from unauthorized access,
        loss, misuse, or alteration. However, no system can be guaranteed to be 100% secure, and you use the site
        at your own risk.
      </p>

      <h2>10. Changes to This Privacy Policy</h2>
      <p>
        We may update this Privacy Policy from time to time to reflect changes in our practices, technologies,
        or legal requirements. The “Last updated” date at the top of this page indicates when this policy was
        most recently revised.
      </p>
      <p>
        If we make material changes, we may provide additional notice (for example, via a banner or in-game notice).
      </p>
